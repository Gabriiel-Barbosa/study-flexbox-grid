# Flexbox and CSS Study
This is a repository created to store files and notes from the Flexbox and CSS course on the Alura platform. The goal of this project is to deepen my knowledge in the area of web page design and layout.

## Course content
The course covers the following topics:

- Introduction to Flexbox
- Advanced Flexbox Resources
- Introduction GRID
- Transforming the layout into GRID
- Responsive with GRID
- GRID container and its areas

## How to use this repository
Each course section has a directory with the files and notes related to that part of the content. In addition, there is an `index.html` file in the root of the repository that serves as a starting point for viewing the examples and experiments conducted during the course.
